"""ppk2d — Nordic PPK2 current-measurement sidecar for the HIL harness (STUB).

Protocol: **line-JSON over stdio**. Read one JSON command per line on stdin, write one JSON reply
per line on stdout. The Rust harness (`src/lib.rs`, `Ppk2`) drives this.

Commands
--------
    {"cmd":"on","mv":<mV>}      enable source-measure at <mV>          -> {"ok":true}
    {"cmd":"off"}               disable the supply                    -> {"ok":true}
    {"cmd":"cycle","mv":<mV>}   power-cycle (off, settle, on) at <mV>  -> {"ok":true}
    {"cmd":"avg","ms":<ms>}     average current over <ms>              -> {"ua":<microamps>}

Why a sidecar (not a Rust PPK2 driver): the PPK2 host protocol + calibration live in Nordic's
Python tooling (`ppk2-api`); wrapping it in a line-JSON process keeps that dependency out of the
Rust harness and lets the confounder handling live in one documented place.

The three known confounders this sidecar is responsible for (see the low-power measurement notes):

 1. **Debug-domain residual (+~200 µA).** A debug probe (J-Link/ST-Link) attached over SWD leaves
    the STM32 debug power domain energised, adding ~200 µA that never goes away until a clean
    power cycle. So `avg` ALWAYS power-cycles first (or requires a prior `cycle`) — never measure
    without cycling.
 2. **~2 V regulator/brown-out knee.** Measured at 3 V the deep-sleep current can read
    artificially low (below the knee the part behaves differently); the honest STOP floor is taken
    at **1.8 V**. This sidecar refuses `on`/`cycle`/`avg` above a sane supply ceiling and the
    harness fixture pins `supply_mv = 1800`.
 3. **PPK2 CDC desync during SWD traffic.** While probe-rs is hammering SWD, the PPK2's USB CDC can
    desync and report bursts of tens of mA of garbage. So this sidecar NEVER samples mid-flash and
    REJECTS any averaged reading above 50 mA as noise (the Rust side enforces the same ceiling).

THIS IS A STUB: it does not open a real PPK2. It models the protocol + the confounder *policy* so
the harness compiles and its plumbing can be unit-tested; wire in `ppk2-api` where marked to drive
real hardware. The hardware HIL tests are `#[ignore]`d, so nothing here runs in CI.
