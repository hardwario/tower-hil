//! HIL power group (feature `power`): measure the Core Module's STOP-mode current floor.
//!
//! Flash the `lowpower` example over SWD with probe-rs (NOT `tower flash` — the UART bootloader
//! needs the FTDI, which must be UNPLUGGED for a real STOP measurement), power-cycle the PPK2 at
//! 1.8 V, and assert the averaged deep-sleep current is under 50 µA.
//!
//! Guard (the whole reason this is subtle): **USB present inhibits STOP by design** — the SDK's
//! console `manager` keeps the low-power executor out of STOP while VBUS is high, so a Core with
//! its FTDI plugged in will never reach the µA floor. If the Core's console still answers, USB is
//! present → we SKIP with an "unplug the FTDI" message rather than record a false ~mA reading.
//!
//! Doubly gated: the whole file is behind `#[cfg(feature = "power")]` AND the test is `#[ignore]`d
//! (it needs the J-Link + PPK2). `cargo test` compiles nothing here unless `--features power`, and
//! runs it only under `just hil-power` (`--features power -- --ignored --test-threads=1`).
